# BigDataHW1

In this homework, you will be using hadoop/mapreduce to analyze social network data.

Q1.
Write a MapReduce program in Hadoop that implements a simple “Mutual/Common friend list of two friends". The key idea is that if two people are friend then they have a lot of mutual/common friends. This program will find the common/mutual friend list for them.

For example,
Alice’s friends are Bob, Sam, Sara, Nancy
Bob’s friends are Alice, Sam, Clara, Nancy
Sara’s friends are Alice, Sam, Clara, Nancy

As Alice and Bob are friend and so, their mutual friend list is [Sam, Nancy]
As Sara and Bob are not friend and so, their mutual friend list is empty. (In this case you may exclude them from your output). 

Input:
Input files 
1. soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt 

The input contains the adjacency list and has multiple lines in the following format:
<User><TAB><Friends>
2. userdata.txt
The userdata.txt contains dummy data which consist of 
column1 : userid
column2 : firstname
column3 : lastname
column4 : address
column5: city
column6 :state
column7 : zipcode
column8 :country
column9 :username
column10 : date of birth.

Here, <User> is a unique integer ID corresponding to a unique user and <Friends> is a comma-separated list of unique IDs corresponding to the friends of the user with the unique ID <User>. Note that the friendships are mutual (i.e., edges are undirected): if A is friend with B then B is also friend with A. The data provided is consistent with that rule as there is an explicit entry for each side of each edge. So when you make the pair, always consider (A, B) or (B, A) for user A and B but not both.

Output: The output should contain one line per user in the following format:
<User_A>, <User_B><TAB><Mutual/Common Friend List>

where <User_A> & <User_B> are unique IDs corresponding to a user A and B (A and B are friend). < Mutual/Common Friend List > is a comma-separated list of unique IDs corresponding to mutual friend list of User A and B.

Find the output for the following pairs:
(0,1), (20, 28193), (1, 29826), (6222, 19272), (28041, 28056)

Submit the source code and the output via the elearning website.


Q2.
Answer this question by using dataset from Q1.
Find friend pairs whose number of common friends (number of mutual friend) is within the top-10 in all the pairs i.e. sort friend pairs in descending order based on the number of common friends they have and output the top-10 pairs.

Output Format:
<User_A>, <User_B><TAB><Number of Mutual Friends><TAB><Mutual/Common Friend Number>

Q3.
Use in-memory join to answer this question.
Given any two Users (they are friend) as input, output the list of the names and the state of their mutual friends.

Note: use the userdata.txt to get the extra user information.

Output format:
UserA id, UserB id, list of [state] of their mutual Friends.

Example of Output:
26112, 28881	[Evangeline: Connecticut, Charlotte: Connecticut]


Q4.
For this question, you are required to use either reduce-side join, map-side join or in-memory join. Analyze what is the task you need to compute by following the steps below and apply the more appropriate type of join for solving such problem. Besides, you are allowed to use job chaining (chaining multiple MapReduce jobs) in this question.

Note: during demonstration of your work, you may be asked why the join you have chosen was an appropriate option for this case.

Step 1: Calculate the average age of the direct friends of each user.
Step 2: Sort the users by the average age from step 1 in descending order.
Step 3. Output the top 15 (15 largest averages) users from step 2 with their address and the calculated average age.

Example of output:  
User A, 1000 Anderson blvd, Dallas, TX, average age of direct friends.


NOTE: The output examples noted in questions above are illustrative and not necessarily correspond to the real data given as input.
